ðŸ§  Why I Built This
To level up my frontend game and recreate one of the cleanest UIs out there.
Also... I just really love Spotify.

ðŸ™Œ Credits
Inspired by Spotifyâ€™s epic design team.
Built by Vidzz with vibes and ctrl+z.

ðŸ–¤ Fun Note
Thereâ€™s not a single line of JavaScript.
Everything moves, floats, and responds using just HTML + CSS.
